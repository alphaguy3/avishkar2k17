                  <h3>Aim:</h3><br>
                  <p>The competition requires the participants to design and fabricate a RC (Radio-Controlled)
   plane (no Readymade Planes are allowed) and perform a set of maneuvers.</p><br>

                  <h3>Rules on Team structure:</h3><br>
                  <ol>
                     <li>Maximum of 5 members in a team</li>
                     <li>Members of a team may be from same college or different .</li>
                     <li>Any number of teams can participate from one college.</li>
                     <li>Professionals are not allowed.</li>
                  </ol><br><br>
                  <h3>Rules on Team structure:</h3><br>
                  <ol>
                     <li>The RC plane should measure a maximum of 1.0 m along any direction .</li>
                     <li>T/W =0.75 (Thrust/Weight ,if excess thrust is found, it will be neutralized by adding weight below the
plane at center of gravity) .</li>
                     <li>The use of IC engines is prohibited. Only electrical motors are allowed</li>
                     <li>The maximum voltage between any two points on the plane should be 12V at any point of time.</li>
                     <li>Use of gyroscopes (gyros) is prohibited</li>
                     <li>One of the team members should fly the aircraft and another should call the stunts as they are
performed</li>
                  </ol><br>

                  <h3>Format of the Competition</h3><br>
                  <p>The event will be conducted at the ground of MNNIT and participants will need to bring their aircraft
and all necessary equipment to this venue. The arena will be an open ground. There will be three rounds
of the competition.</p><br>

                  <ol>
                     <li>Qualifier Round
                        <ul style="margin-top: 2%;margin-left: 2%;">
                           <li>
                              <b><u>Target Landing</u></b> :- Participants have to fly their plane from given start point to given landing zone by crossing a rope at
certain height.<br>
The teams will be graded based on :
Landing in different zones and time taken.
                           </li>
                           <li style="margin-top: 1%;">
                              <b><u>Gliding</u></b> :- The best measure of the design of an aircraft can be done by climb and gliding time. To examine this,
participants have to climb for 30 seconds. After this, they need to perform a dead stick flight (throttle=0
or Gliding). The plane however can be maneuvered while its gliding.<br>
The teams will be graded based on : Smooth Climb (35%) and Glide Time (65%)
                           </li>
                        </ul>
                     </li>
                     <li>Maneuver: - A horizontal eight loop around the 2 vertical poles, 25 points per loop (none for incomplete loop).
                     </li>
                  </ol><br><br>

                  <h3>Rules:</h3><br>
                  <ol>
                     <li>Each team would be given 2 chances for each of the rounds and the best score is considered as per
the scoring procedure mentioned above for each round.</li>
                     <li>The timer will start from the moment the aircraft is in the air for both the rounds.</li>
                  </ol><br><br>

                  <h3>General Information:</h3><br>
                  <ol>
                     <li>The use of 2.4 GHz radio is required for all aircraft competing in the competition. If the participants
want to use any other frequency, they will have to inform the organizers in advance.</li>
                     <li>A limited number of 2.4 GHz radios will be available with the organizers for use by the teams. Teams

                     <li>Metal propellers are not allowed.</li>
                     <li>The models can have powered take-off with a landing gear or can be launched manually by a person
standing at ground level.</li>
                     <li>Plane should be built from scratch and not purchased models</li>
                     <li>A team member canâ€™t be a part of more than one team at any one given competition.</li>
                     <li>Bring your college/student I-Card at the time of competition.</li>
